#Q1: What is the problem you want to solve?
#Q2: Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
#Q3: What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
#Q4: In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
#Q5: What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.



#A1: The problem I want to solve is: what variables most influence the financial success of a video game
#A2: My client is potential video game investors, game designers, and anyone else interested in the situation.
    #The video game investor will decide on which games to invest based on my analysis to maximize income
    #The video game designers will design their games based on my analysis to maximize income
#A3: I am going to use data from Kaggle (url:  https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings)
#A4: I will plot different variables (x axis) on multiple graphs (y axis = income) and see if there are strong correlations.
#A5: My deliverables are the code I used in the Jupyter IPython Notebook, which includes the graphs, as well as my interpretation of the results
